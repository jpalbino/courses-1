<!-- machine-learning -->

Notation:

* m = Number of training examples
* x's = input variables / features
* y's = output variables / target variables
* (x, y) = one training example
* (xi, yi) = i-th training example

h - (hypothesis) function that maps x's to y's

Linear regression:

h(x) = x * w1 + w0

* w's - parameters of the model
