## Executive Summary

The main goal of this project is to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) from the `mtcars` data set. We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

Short summary:

* Cars with manual transmission have significantly more miles per gallon than cars with automatic transmission;
* Manual transmission is better for MPG by 1.8 compared to automatic transmission (adj. by `cyl`, `hp`, `wt`).

## Load the Data and Exploratory Analysis

```{r settings, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

In this analysis, we will use the `mtcars` data set. This data was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine. It comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). First, we will load the data and perform basic exploration. We will also factor some of the variables for convenience.

```{r load, echo=FALSE}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
```

```{r factor, echo=FALSE}
# factor some variables for convenience
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("auto", "manual"))
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
```

```{r basicexploration}
head(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```

The exploratory plots can be seen in the Appendix (Appendix - Figure: Exploratory plots). 

## Analysis

We will further focus on relationship between MPG and transmission (`mpg` and `am`), with `mpg` as the outcome and `am` as the predictor. As can be seen in the boxplot of MPG by transmission type, there is an increase in MPG when transmission is manual comparing to automatic transmission.

```{r boxplot, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(am, mpg, fill=am), data = mtcars) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("MPG") + xlab("Transmission type") + 
  theme_update(legend.position=c(0.85, 0.15))
```

To find out if this increase is statistically significant, we will perform a t-test (assuming that the distribution is normal) with the null hypothesis: mean MPG in cars with automatic transmission is the same as MPG in cars with manual transmission.

```{r ttest}
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
```

With p-value of ``r round(t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)$p.value, 4)``, we can reject the null hypothesis and see that this difference is significant.


### Linear Regression Model

```{r}
lin.model <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(lin.model)
```

The intercept coefficient (``r round(coef(lin.model)[1], 4)``) is the empirical mean of MPG for cars with automatic transmissions. The `am` coefficient (``r round(coef(lin.model)[2], 4)``) is the mean increase of MPG for cars with manual transmissions. The mean MPG for cars with manual transmissions is `intercept` + `am` = ``r round(coef(lin.model)[1] + coef(lin.model)[2], 4)``.

The p-value is `r round(0.000285, 4)`, which means that there is a significant difference in MPG between groups with different transmission. However, the adjusted R-squared is ``r round(summary(lin.model)$adj.r.squared, 4)``, which means that only ~34% of the variability is explained by this model. This percentage is relatively small, so we should find out which of other variables could be predictors in our model.

### Multivariable Regression Model

To begin with, we will build a model with `mpg` as the outcome and all other variables as predictors. Next, we will use this model as the initial model in the stepwise search by `step` algorithm.

```{r, results='hide'}
init.model <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
step.model <- step(init.model)
```
```{r}
summary(step.model)
```

The best model found by the `step` algorithm contains `cyl` (number of cylinders), `hp` (gross horsepower), `wt` (weight), and `am` (transmission) variables. We have compared this model with the linear model (Appendix - Figure: Comparing regression models). From the results, we can tell that there are significant differences between two models, in other words, `cyl`, `hp`, and `wt` variables increase accuracy of the model. With these three variables as confounders, adjusted R-squared is ``r round(summary(step.model)$adj.r.squared, 4)``, meaning ~84% of the variability is explained by the model above.
