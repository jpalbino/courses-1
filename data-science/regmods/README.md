## Context

You work for *Motor Trend*, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).

They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
* How exactly the MPG differs between automatic and manual transmissions?
 
Take the `mtcars` data set and write up your report to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.
