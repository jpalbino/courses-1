Review the code books for the data sets made available to you.

STEP 1: Choose a data set that you would like to work with.

=======
At first, I wanted to work with the **The Mars Craters Study** data set, because I don't know much about Mars craters and Mars geography at all, and working with this data set would be a good opportunity for me to learn more on this topic. But it turned out my knowledge of this planet was not enough to understand the codebook, so I chose **the GapMinder** data set, because it is global and allows to compare data between countries.

**The GapMinder** data includes one year of numerous country-level indicators of health, wealth and development. In particular, I am interested in investigating association between these two variables:

* `breastcancerper100th`: new cases of breast cancer per 100,000 female (in a year),
* `internetuserate`: Internet users (per 100 people).

I add to my codebook these variables:

breastcancerper100TH | Breast cancer new cases per 100,000 female. Number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the certain year. | ARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer)
internetuserate | Internet users (per 100 people). Internet users are people with access to the worldwide network. | World Bank

develop a hypothesis about what you believe the association might be between these topics. Be sure to integrate the specific variables you selected into the hypothesis.

## Literature Review
Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com)



Specific rubric items, and their point values, are as follows: 
Has the learner selected a data set and indicated that selection? (1 point) 
Has the learner clearly stated a research question and hypothesis? (2 points) 
Does the literature review include clear information about search terms used? (1 point) 
Does the literature review clearly identify references used? (2 points) 
Does the literature review clearly present a summary of findings (e.g., variables considered, patterns of findings, etc.)? (2 points)
